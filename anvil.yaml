        \ provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES\
        \ OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including,\
        \ without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,\
        \ MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely\
        \ responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing\
        \ the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions\
        \ under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under\
        \ no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract,\
        \ or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate\
        \ and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor\
        \ be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n\
        \      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n\
        \      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n\
        \      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n\
        \      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n  \
        \    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n     \
        \ has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting\
        \ Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or\
        \ Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee\
        \ for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability\
        \ obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However,\
        \ in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf\
        \ and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor,\
        \ and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor\
        \ harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against,\
        \ such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or\
        \ additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX:\
